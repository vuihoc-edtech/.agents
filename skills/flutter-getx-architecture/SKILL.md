description: Build or refactor Flutter apps that use GetX with clear module boundaries, disciplined dependency injection, practical reactive state, and a strict API stack based on `retrofit`, `json_serializable`, and `result_dart`. Use when Codex needs to organize GetX features, split controllers and views, add bindings, standardize navigation and dependency setup, or stop GetX usage from spreading chaotically across the app.

# Flutter GetX Architecture

## Goal

Use GetX as a practical app architecture tool, not as an excuse to mix routing, state, UI, and data access in the same file.

This skill favors feature-based structure, route-level dependency injection, thin views, and controllers that coordinate state instead of owning the whole application.

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect the current GetX setup first

Read only the files needed to understand how GetX is currently used:

- `pubspec.yaml`
- app entry points such as `lib/main.dart`
- bootstrap files such as `app/bootstrap/`
- route definitions such as `app_pages.dart`, `app_routes.dart`, or `routes/`
- feature folders that contain `view`, `controller`, `binding`, or `service`
- base controller or base service abstractions if they exist

Use fast searches first:

```bash
rg -n "GetMaterialApp|GetPage|Bindings|BindingsBuilder|GetxController|GetView|GetWidget|Get\\.put|Get\\.lazyPut|Get\\.find|\\.obs|Obx\\(|GetBuilder\\(|GetxService"
```

Decide which case applies:

- If the app already has a clean feature structure, extend it instead of inventing a new layout.
- If `Get.put` and `Get.find` are scattered through views, move dependencies toward bindings and constructors where possible.
- If controllers own networking, persistence, mapping, and UI state together, split responsibilities before adding more features.

### 2. Keep bootstrap separate from feature and runtime code

Keep `main.dart` thin and move startup orchestration into `app/bootstrap/`.

Prefer bootstrap code for:

- binding initialization
- env and DI setup
- storage boot
- service startup
- deep link startup
- localization startup
- final app launch

Avoid letting feature code, controllers, or random services own app startup.

Also optimize bootstrap sequencing:

- only `await` work that is required before the next step can proceed
- keep truly dependent steps sequential
- group independent startup tasks with `Future.wait(...)`
- avoid blocking startup on results that are not needed immediately

### 3. Organize UI by feature, but allow a shared data layer

Prefer feature-based modules for GetX presentation code:

- feature folder
- controller
- view
- widgets

Bindings may live either:

- near the feature when the dependency graph is small and clearly local
- in a centralized app-level bindings layer when many routes share the same dependencies or when you want one place to inspect route composition

Prefer a shared data layer for remote API code when:

- the app has few API groups
- DTOs are reused across multiple features
- one backend contract serves many screens
- the generic envelope such as `ApiResponse<T>` is shared across the whole app

Keep feature-only code inside the feature. Move transport-level code to shared app data when reuse is real.

Repositories live in `app/data/repositories/` as a single app-wide rule.

Read [references/getx-module-blueprint.md](references/getx-module-blueprint.md) for the default module structure.

### 4. Use `Bindings` as the default dependency composition point

Prefer:

- route-level `Bindings`
- `Get.lazyPut` or equivalent GetX registration for controllers, GetX stores, and GetX-specific services
- `Get.putAsync` only for dependencies that truly require async initialization
- `GetxService` for app-wide long-lived services

Avoid:

- calling `Get.put` from widget build methods
- ad-hoc `Get.find` in many leaf widgets
- using GetX bindings as a general-purpose container for every dependency in the app

Each feature route should declare what it needs. Dependency graphs should be discoverable from bindings, not hidden in random widget trees.

Do not force bindings into feature folders if centralized bindings make route composition clearer.

Keep the DI boundary explicit:

- use GetX bindings for GetX controllers, GetX stores, and GetX-specific services
- use `get_it` for app infrastructure such as `Dio`, Retrofit APIs, env config, preferences wrappers, Realm setup, repositories, and other non-GetX dependencies

Do not assume folder location defines DI ownership. A file under `app/services/` may still belong to `get_it` if it is not GetX-coupled.

### 5. Keep controllers focused on presentation orchestration

Controllers should usually:

- hold screen state
- call use-case, repository, or service methods
- expose reactive fields for the view
- translate user actions into app behavior

Controllers should usually not:

- render widget trees
- contain raw HTTP code
- parse JSON directly unless the app is very small
- become god objects that manage multiple unrelated screens

Read [references/getx-controller-rules.md](references/getx-controller-rules.md) for controller boundaries.

### 6. Enforce the API stack: `retrofit` + `json_serializable` + `result_dart`

For networked features, API access must use:

- `retrofit` for REST client declarations
- `json_serializable` for request and response model mapping
- `result_dart` for repository and app-facing success or failure flows
- generated `*.g.dart` and Retrofit client files via `build_runner`

Prefer this flow:

- controller calls repository
- repository calls shared Retrofit data source or API client
- Retrofit client returns DTO or a generic response envelope model
- `json_serializable` handles `fromJson` and `toJson`
- repository converts transport success or failure into `ResultDart<T, AppFailure>` or the project's equivalent typed failure contract

Avoid:

- raw `Dio` or `http` calls inside controllers
- manual `Map<String, dynamic>` parsing in controllers or views
- handwritten serializer boilerplate when `json_serializable` should own it
- mixing transport DTOs directly with unrelated UI state when a mapping boundary is needed
- naming a custom generic wrapper `Response<T>` because it conflicts with `dio.Response`
- throwing ad-hoc exceptions through controllers when a typed result would keep error handling explicit

Read [references/retrofit-json-serialization-rules.md](references/retrofit-json-serialization-rules.md) for the required structure and generation flow.

### 7. Choose local persistence deliberately: `shared_preferences` or `realm`

For local persistence, prefer only these two storage directions unless the user explicitly asks otherwise:

- `shared_preferences` for small, simple, stable key-value settings that need quick access
- `realm` for dynamic user data, larger local datasets, or data shapes that will likely grow over time

Prefer `shared_preferences` for:

- onboarding flags
- selected locale
- theme mode
- feature toggles
- tiny cached primitives

If the app already uses `get_it` or `injectable` for bootstrap dependencies, it is acceptable to pre-resolve the shared preferences wrapper there so app-level settings are ready before first use.

Prefer `realm` for:

- user-generated content
- cached profiles, feeds, drafts, or history
- structured objects or collections
- data that changes often or may later require richer queries

Avoid:

- storing growing JSON blobs in `shared_preferences`
- treating `shared_preferences` like a mini database
- preloading too many preference keys at startup without a clear reason
- mixing multiple DI styles without a clear composition boundary

Read [references/local-storage-rules.md](references/local-storage-rules.md) for the storage decision rules.

### 8. Generate asset access with `flutter_gen`

Do not hardcode asset paths in widgets, themes, or services.

Use:

- `flutter_gen_runner` for generated asset access
- generated classes such as `Assets.images.logo`, `Assets.icons.close`, or generated font helpers
- `pubspec.yaml` as the source of truth for asset declarations

Prefer:

- `Assets.images.logo.image()`
- `Assets.icons.close.svg()`
- `Assets.images.banner.path`

Avoid:

- `Image.asset('assets/images/logo.png')`
- raw string paths spread across the app
- duplicating asset path constants by hand

Read [references/flutter-gen-asset-rules.md](references/flutter-gen-asset-rules.md) for the setup and usage rules.

### 9. Manage app environment with `envied`

Use `envied` for environment configuration instead of hardcoding base URLs, API keys, or feature flags in source files.

Prefer:

- a generated env class under an app-level env folder
- `.env` or environment-specific env files as build inputs
- typed access such as `Env.apiBaseUrl`

Avoid:

- scattering `const String baseUrl = ...` across the app
- reading raw `.env` files directly in runtime code
- duplicating environment constants in multiple files

Read [references/envied-rules.md](references/envied-rules.md) for the setup and usage rules.

### 10. Use `worker_manager` only when background compute is justified

For CPU-intensive or repeated background work, consider `worker_manager`.

Prefer `worker_manager` when:

- the task is CPU-bound and risks blocking the UI thread
- the work is repeated enough that isolate reuse is worthwhile
- parsing, transformation, compression, encryption, or other heavy computation happens often

Do not introduce `worker_manager` when:

- the task is small
- the work happens rarely
- ordinary async code is already sufficient
- isolate management would add more complexity than value

Read [references/worker-manager-rules.md](references/worker-manager-rules.md) for the decision rules.

### 11. Handle deep links through an app-level `DeeplinkService`

Use a dedicated app-level `DeeplinkService` for deep links and navigation links.

Prefer:

- `app_links` as the incoming link source
- one `DeeplinkService` under `app/services/`
- early initialization so the first cold-start link is not missed
- handling only app-owned path prefixes such as `/a/*` or `/app/*`
- mapping incoming URIs into explicit navigation intents or route commands before handing them to navigation
- one `DeeplinkService.navigate(String url)` entrypoint for validation and routing

Avoid:

- parsing deep links directly inside views or controllers
- letting many features subscribe to `app_links` independently
- mixing Flutter's default deep link handling with plugin-based handling
- opening the app for arbitrary website paths that were not designed for app navigation

If using `app_links`, disable Flutter's default deep link handler:

- set `flutter_deeplinking_enabled` to `false` in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- set `FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled` to `false` in `Info.plist`

Read [references/deeplink-rules.md](references/deeplink-rules.md) for the service and platform rules.

### 12. Keep localization app-level with `app_en.arb` + `arb_translate`

Treat localization as an app-level concern.

Prefer:

- `app_en.arb` as the single human-written source of truth
- content writers writing English only in `app_en.arb`
- `arb_translate` generating the other locale ARB files
- `gen_l10n` generating the localization access classes used by the app

Avoid:

- editing translated ARB files manually unless there is a specific correction workflow
- hardcoding user-facing strings in Dart widgets
- letting each feature invent a separate localization mechanism

Read [references/localization-rules.md](references/localization-rules.md) for the localization workflow.

### 13. Choose reactivity deliberately

Use the simplest tool that matches the state shape.

Prefer:

- simple fields + `update()` with `GetBuilder` for localized rebuild regions
- `.obs` + `Obx` for truly reactive values that change independently
- `StateMixin` only when it genuinely clarifies async UI states

Avoid:

- making every field `.obs`
- wrapping large screens in one giant `Obx`
- nesting reactive builders without a clear reason

Read [references/getx-reactivity-rules.md](references/getx-reactivity-rules.md) for when to use `Obx`, `GetBuilder`, and workers.

### 14. Keep views thin and predictable

Views should usually:

- read controller state
- wire callbacks
- compose widgets
- delegate repeated sections to feature widgets or shared widgets

Views should usually not:

- fetch dependencies in many places
- run business logic inline
- contain duplicated loading, empty, or error handling everywhere

Prefer one controller per screen or tightly related flow. If a screen needs too many controller responsibilities, split the feature instead of stacking more reactive variables.

### 15. Keep navigation and side effects explicit

Use GetX navigation intentionally:

- define routes centrally
- use bindings to prepare dependencies before entering a screen
- keep navigation methods readable and close to feature intent

Do not hide important side effects behind generic helpers if that makes call sites impossible to reason about.

For app-wide effects such as auth session, connectivity, or local storage bootstrapping, prefer dedicated services.

### 16. Validate before finishing

Before wrapping up:

- confirm dependencies are registered in predictable places
- confirm `main.dart` stays thin and bootstrap logic lives under `app/bootstrap/`
- confirm bootstrap does not use unnecessary sequential `await` chains
- confirm GetX bindings only register GetX-facing objects
- confirm non-GetX infrastructure is resolved from `get_it` or the project's app-level DI container
- confirm controllers do not own too many responsibilities
- confirm API clients use `retrofit`
- confirm JSON models use `json_serializable`
- confirm repositories return explicit results instead of leaking transport exceptions upward
- confirm local storage choice matches data size and volatility
- confirm assets are accessed through generated APIs instead of raw strings
- confirm environment values come from `envied` instead of ad-hoc constants
- confirm `worker_manager` is used only for work heavy enough to justify isolate complexity
- confirm deep links are handled through one app-level service
- confirm Flutter's default deep link handler is disabled when using `app_links`
- confirm English text lives in `app_en.arb` as the source of truth
- confirm translated ARB files are generated through `arb_translate`
- confirm reactive rebuild scope is narrow enough
- confirm views are thinner than before
- remove unnecessary `Get.find`, `.obs`, or wrapper builders
- run the smallest useful validation set

Typical commands:

```bash
dart format <changed-files>
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
dart analyze
flutter test
```

If full validation cannot run, report exactly what was and was not validated.

## Output Expectations

When using this skill, finish with a short summary that includes:

- which feature or route boundaries changed
- whether bindings and dependency injection were standardized
- whether controller responsibilities became clearer
- whether the API layer was normalized to `retrofit`, `json_serializable`, and `result_dart`
- whether local persistence was placed in `shared_preferences` or `realm` for the right reasons
- whether asset access was normalized to `flutter_gen`
- whether app configuration was normalized to `envied`
- whether background compute used `worker_manager` appropriately or was intentionally avoided
- whether deep links were centralized in `DeeplinkService`
- whether localization was normalized to `app_en.arb` plus `arb_translate`
- whether reactive usage was simplified or narrowed
- any remaining architectural debt

## Heuristics

- Feature scope first, global scope second.
- Bindings are the default composition root for GetX features.
- Controllers orchestrate; services and repositories execute.
- API contracts use `retrofit`; JSON mapping uses `json_serializable`; repository flows use `result_dart`.
- Small stable keys use `shared_preferences`; evolving user data uses `realm`.
- Assets use `flutter_gen`, not hardcoded paths.
- App environment uses `envied`, not duplicated constants.
- `worker_manager` is for heavy repeated compute, not default async work.
- Deep links flow through one `DeeplinkService`, not scattered listeners.
- English content lives in `app_en.arb`; other locales come from `arb_translate`.
- Use the smallest reactive surface that works.
- If GetX usage becomes invisible magic, the architecture is too implicit.
