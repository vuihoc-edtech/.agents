# Design System Rules

## Core Principle

Use an 8pt spacing rhythm as the default layout language. Use 4dp only for tight micro-adjustments.

This keeps the UI calm, professional, and predictable while avoiding the random spacing that often makes AI-generated interfaces look fake.

## Spacing Scale

Default spacing scale:

- `0`
- `4`
- `8`
- `16`
- `24`
- `32`
- `40`
- `48`
- `64`

Practical usage:

- `4`: tiny internal adjustment only
- `8`, `16`: default component padding and stack gaps
- `24`: section padding, card interior spacing
- `32`, `40`, `48`, `64`: page-level spacing and large empty space

Rules:

- Never use odd spacing values.
- Avoid `6`, `10`, `12`, `14`, `18`, `20`, `22` unless an existing system already depends on them and a migration is out of scope.
- Prefer `8`, `16`, `24`, `32` as the dominant rhythm of the app.
- Prefer fewer spacing values used consistently over a mathematically complete scale.

## Border Radius Scale

Approved radius scale:

- `0`
- `4`
- `8`
- `12`
- `16`
- `24`
- `999`

Practical usage:

- `4`: dense chips, tiny tags, compact fields
- `8`: default buttons, inputs, cards in compact systems
- `12`: modern default for cards, sheets, inputs in consumer apps
- `16`: large cards, prominent containers, bottom sheets
- `24`: highly rounded panels
- `999`: pill, capsule, avatar masks

Rules:

- Do not use arbitrary values like `7`, `10`, `14`, `18` unless the system already defines them.
- Pick one default radius for primary surfaces and one secondary radius for larger surfaces.
- Most apps work well with `8` and `12` as the default pair, or `12` and `16` for softer consumer UI.
- If boxes are visually nested, keep radii mathematically concentric: inner radius should usually equal outer radius minus the surrounding padding.

## Border and Elevation

Approved border widths:

- `1`
- `2`

Use `1` by default. Use `2` only when contrast or emphasis needs it.

Elevation rules:

- prefer subtle elevation
- use border plus surface contrast before adding heavy shadows
- keep the number of shadow presets small
- do not use large hand-made shadows by default
- prefer `Material` elevation or extremely soft shadows only when hierarchy truly needs them
- if using `BoxShadow`, keep it extremely restrained: small blur, no exaggerated spread, very low alpha

## Component Heights

Recommended interactive heights:

- `32`: dense controls only
- `40`: compact but usable
- `48`: default tap target
- `56`: prominent CTA or input

Rules:

- Keep touch targets at or above `44`, preferably `48`
- Avoid visually tiny controls even if the content technically fits

## Icon Sizes

Approved icon sizes:

- `16`
- `20`
- `24`
- `32`

Use `24` as the default action icon size.

## Typography

Recommended mobile text scale:

- `12`: helper or caption
- `14`: secondary body, label
- `16`: default body
- `20`: section title
- `24`: screen title
- `32`: large display

Rules:

- Keep body text readable before making it stylish
- Use consistent line height, usually around `1.3` to `1.5`
- Avoid many near-duplicate sizes such as `15`, `17`, `19`, `23`
- prioritize clarity and reading comfort over display-like decoration

## Color System

Use semantic roles instead of raw color names:

- `primary`
- `onPrimary`
- `secondary`
- `background`
- `surface`
- `surfaceContainer`
- `outline`
- `error`
- `warning`
- `success`

Rules:

- Avoid hardcoding hex values in leaf widgets
- Use role-based colors so light and dark themes remain possible
- Favor contrast and hierarchy over decoration
- avoid neon, cyber, and loud gradient treatments unless they are core to the product direction
- ensure text and background contrast remains accessible

## Layout Rules

- Default screen horizontal padding is usually `16`
- Use `24` when the layout needs more breathing room or on tablet-width containers
- Keep lists and forms aligned to the same horizontal rhythm
- A screen should usually have one dominant visual rhythm, not many unrelated ones
- prioritize content over framing; remove borders and background panels that do not improve comprehension

## Component Composition Rules

- Avoid "container hell": do not stack more than two decorative `Container` layers without a specific visual reason.
- Prefer `Padding`, `SizedBox`, `Divider`, `Row`, `Column`, and slivers for structure.
- Prefer semantic Flutter widgets such as `Card`, `CircleAvatar`, `AppBar`, `ListTile`, `TextButton`, and `IconButton`.
- If app-wide visual consistency is required, build base components in the design system and consume those instead of rebuilding styled containers in feature code.
- Split complex UI sections into `StatelessWidget` components so the screen remains readable and maintainable.

## Decision Rules

When unsure:

1. pick the nearest approved token
2. prefer consistency over local perfection
3. add a new token only if the value repeats or carries semantic meaning
